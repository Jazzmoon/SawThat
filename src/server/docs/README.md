# Saw That?

As a kid, Mark and his sister were obsessed with Screenlife's DVD Trivia game called [**Scene It?**][SceneIt]. Sadly, those games are no longer being produced anymore, as the medium of DVD game isn't very popular anymore. However, especially due to the recent pandemic, remote games, such as those featured in [Jackbox Party Packs][JPP], that you can play with friends have become more and more valued.

**Saw That?** is intended to bring the DVD trivia game genre that **Scene It?** revolutionized into a more modernized medium, in the hopes that it will become a popular game if the rights can be obtained to the different themes you want to make.

If you wanted to play a [**Disney**][Disney] themed **Saw That?** game, all you would need to do is download the source code, make an asset pack, and make the questions for it.

Because we don't own the rights to any media snippets, we can't release a version of the game that is already populated with Trivia questions. The most we can do is make the infrastructure in the hopes that you guys will make fun content packs and maybe find a way of sharing those.

## Plans

### The Game

**Scene It?** consists of a series of player pieces, a board (start, 34/46 spaces, and a stop), a deck of trivia cards, consequence cards, and the game disc with mini-games that have been sorted into 2 categories (all-play and my-play). For the sake of this project, all components would need to be digitalized and controlled by the master node. Below is a detailed description of what each component does within **SceneIt?**

#### Game Play

The basic premise of the game is that 2-8 players are attempting to race around the board, answering trivia questions to ensure they move forward. 2 dice are rolled at the beginning of each turn:

- The movement die, a D6, and
- The challenge die, a D8

The value of the movement die determines how many spaces you move forward IF you manage to complete the challenge chosen by the value of the challenge die. If you fail the challenge, you do not move forward, and your turn is forfeit.

#### The Game Board

The game board comes with 2 primary play options:

- Short Game, which consists of 34 spaces, with a "x2" space at the halfway point,
- And Long Game, which consists of 46 spaces, with a "x2" space at the quarter, halfway, and three-quarter points.

The times two space doubles the die value in which determines movement score.

#### Trivia Cards

Trivia cards are divided into 3 categories:

- Take Three, which consists of 3 clues being given that hint to the final answer,
- Songs, Slogans, and Taglines, which consists of a single clue that hints to the final answer which is related to a song, slogan, or tagline of a film,
- and Miscellaneous, which consists of a single clue that hints to the final answer which is related to a topic unrelated to the previous categories.

#### Consequence Cards

Consequence cards are a fun way to add a bit of spice to the game. They are always a "successful" role, meaning you are guaranteed to move forward the value of your movement die. However, you must also face the consequences of the card. Consequences are not always negative however... Some cards move you forward another few spaces, or even give you a free turn. However, the opposite can also occur, such as moving you back a few spaces, or even losing a turn. Exacts can be discussed by group members, as you are free to assign whatever consequences you want to the cards.

#### Mini-Games

### Development and Design

#### Frontend Serving

After getting aquatinted with [**ReactJS**][ReactJS] over the summer, we plan on using a version of that to host the front-end. Either using [ReactJS][ReactJS] itself, or a minified version of it called [**NextJS**][NextJS]. Communication to the backend API would likely then be done using [Axios][Axios], and a websocket would be established allowing the game to be played synchronously with other players across various devices.

If **ReactJS** is not used, the back-up framework of choice would be [**VueJS**][VueJS], which is a similar framework to **ReactJS** but with a different syntax.

#### Backend API

Due to choice of Typescript supported front-end frameworks, it only makes sense to maintain the TypeScript language base across the entire project. Therefore, the plan is to use NodeJS's [ExpressJS][ExpressJS] framework to create the API. The API would be responsible for handling the game logic, and communicating with the database to store and retrieve data.

#### Database

The database design will require a lot of planning from the development group, but we know that each game will be assigned a unique join code and store a timeout value in the event of the game becoming fully idle. Players would not be required to make accounts, and thus won't need to be stored in the database. However, the game will need to store the player's name, and the player's score. The game will also need to store the questions and answers for each game, and the game's theme.

We will also need to record the Game's state in memory, so that way everyone in the game is seeing the correct game board.
